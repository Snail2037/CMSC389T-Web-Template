## Changes 

I restyled the linkedin and github buttons with hover effects and animations upon clicking each button. I also added a subheader "Interests" with bullets listing each interests. In addition to the buttons in the bottom, I added a social media link via a Facebook button, which redirects the user to my own profile after clicking.
